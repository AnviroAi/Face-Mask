# Real-Time Face Mask Detection

This project is a short and practical computer vision application designed to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks in real time using a live webcam feed.

The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces in each frame, and classifies each detected face as either "Mask" or "No Mask" using a pre-trained deep learning model. Visual feedback is provided by drawing bounding boxes and labels directly on the video stream to indicate the prediction for each face.

This project is intended for interns or beginners learning computer vision and deep learning. It demonstrates key concepts such as real-time video processing, face detection, and image classification, all integrated into a single, interactive application.

Optional extensions include adding an alert mechanism when a person without a mask is detected or tracking the number of violations over time.
